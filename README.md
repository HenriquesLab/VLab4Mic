# SupraMolSim

A Universal Validation Tool for Macromolecular Complexes in Fluorescence Microscopy

SupraMolSim is a library that focused on modelling Macromolecule Labelling and simulates their detection across imaging modalities to validate feature recovery under variable conditions.

Current features include:
- Creattion of a structural model from PDB data
- Direct and indirect labelling of PDB structures
- Modelling structural defects
- Structure detection as Image Generation for common microscopy modalities
- Parameter sweeps 
- And more!
